Summary
-------

Memory Game written in C++ using SDL graphic library

Building
--------

### On GNU/Linux:
To build the game you will need SDL developement library: [www.libsdl.org](http://www.libsdl.org). On debian-based distributions, a simple
    sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev
should do the job.
Then
    make
    ./memory-game
    
### On Windows:
No tested yet, but you will just need to install SDL as well, and put the SDL dll file in the same directory as the built exe.

About
-----

This little game is intended to have fun, train your memory skills and obviously for the developper to play with SDL Library features and object-oriented programming

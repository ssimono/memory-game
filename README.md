Summary
-------

Memory Game written in C++ using SDL graphic library

Building
--------

### On GNU/Linux:
To build the game you will need:

* SDL developement library: [www.libsdl.org](http://www.libsdl.org)
* SDL_ttf development library [http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf).

On debian-based distributions, a simple
`sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev`
should do the job.

Then `make` to build the game.

About
-----

This little game is intended to have fun, train your memory skills and obviously for the developper to play with SDL Library features and object-oriented programming
